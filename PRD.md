# Product Requirements Document: Afterglow

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Greenlit  
**Date:** May 15, 2026  
**Hackathon:** Music Hackspace Music Technology Hackathon, Lisbon

---

## 1. Overview

**Product Name:** Afterglow

**One-Line Description:** A spatial DJ library browsing system organized by timeline of day and performance contexts instead of metadata alone.

**Tagline:** "Organize your library by how you actually DJ. Discover what you have. Feel confident in uncertain gigs."

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Real Problem
DJs organize their libraries with technical metadata (genre, BPM, key) because that's what existing tools support. But when actually preparing to perform, DJs navigate by emotional and situational logic: **When would I play this? Why? What's the crowd state?**

This mismatch is especially painful for **DJs in uncertain, spontaneous scenarios**:
- Multi-day events (Burning Man, festivals) with both scheduled gigs AND spontaneous moments
- Asked to play a camp at 4 AM when you weren't expecting it
- Booked for a brunch but might get pulled to play sunrise wind-down instead
- Last-minute gigs where you don't know the exact context until you arrive
- Events where you need to be ready for *anything* across multiple times of day

**Current friction:**
- Great tracks get lost because they don't fit folder structures
- Organization is mentally heavy; takes time away from practicing
- Confidence drops when gigs are spontaneous
- Browse experience is linear (lists, filters) not exploratory (discovery)

### Why It Matters
An emerging DJ who feels blocked by their organization system stops DJing. A confident DJ discovers cross-genre combinations they wouldn't have found otherwise. Organization directly impacts creativity and performance.

---

## 3. Solution Overview

### What Afterglow Is
A three-layer library browsing system:

1. **Timeline of the Day** — Choose your scenario (Pool Party, Sunrise Reset, Afterglow, etc.)
2. **Spatial Mood Constellation** — Spatial arrangement of your library by performance contexts (who's here? what role does this track play?)
3. **Track Details** — Click to see artist, duration, tags, play count, and why it belongs in this zone

### What Afterglow Is NOT
- A recommendation engine (DJ decides; system organizes)
- A mixing or playback tool (prep tool, not performance tool)
- An all-in-one DJ platform (scoped library browsing only)
- A mood tagging system (tags reflect DJ decision-making: when/why/crowd)

### Core Value
- **For the DJ:** Prep a spontaneous gig in 10 minutes instead of 30+. Rediscover forgotten material. Feel confident.
- **For emerging DJs:** Reduce mental load of organizing. Make better use of their library.
- **For the product:** Organize libraries the way DJs actually think, not how systems traditionally categorize.

---

## 4. Target User

### Primary User
**Emerging and casual DJs** (playing 1–4 gigs/month, 500–5,000 tracks)
- Often self-booked or spontaneously asked to play
- May feel overwhelmed by organization systems
- Needs confidence in uncertain situations
- Thinks in moods and moments, not BPM/genre

### Secondary User
**Experienced DJs** who want to:
- Rediscover underplayed material
- Explore cross-genre combinations
- Organize around performance contexts (not just metadata)

### All Users
Anyone preparing for **uncertain performance scenarios** (unknown timing, unknown crowd, unknown setup).

---

## 5. User Stories (MVP Scope)

### Primary Story: Be Ready for Spontaneity
**As a** DJ at a multi-day event (e.g., Burning Man) where I might get asked to play unexpectedly  
**I want to** quickly access organized tracks for any scenario (sunrise wind-down, 4 AM dance floor, brunch vibes, etc.)  
**So that** I can say yes to spontaneous gigs without scrambling and feel confident across uncertainty

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Timeline view shows multiple day/night contexts I can navigate to instantly
- For any context, I can scan available tracks in <2 minutes
- I can understand why each track is positioned where it is (see its tags and role)
- No friction: I don't scroll through hundreds of tracks to find what fits a moment
- I feel genuinely ready to play *anything* at *any time*

**Real-world example:** I'm at Burning Man with scheduled gigs but might get asked to DJ a sunrise wind-down or a 4 AM dance floor. I open Sunrise Reset or Late Night, I see exactly what I have, and I can say yes immediately.

---

### Secondary Story: Rediscover Forgotten Material in Context
**As a** DJ prepping for any gig (scheduled or spontaneous)  
**I want to** find tracks I haven't played in months that fit the specific context I need  
**So that** I have fresh material, feel more creative, and rediscover gems I'd totally forgotten

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Underplayed tracks (play count < 5) are visually marked in the constellation
- Underplayed tracks appear in their relevant contexts, not hidden away
- The rediscovery feels genuine ("Wait, this is perfect and I hadn't thought about it")
- I discover 3–5 tracks per context that I'd forgotten but would actually play

---

### Supporting Story: Understand the Logic Behind Track Placement
**As a** DJ browsing the constellation  
**I want to** click a track and see why it's positioned in this zone  
**So that** I understand the system's logic and trust the organization (instead of feeling like a black box)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Click track → detail view shows artist, duration, tags
- Tags clearly explain: When (Time/Setting)? Why (Journey Role)? What crowd (Crowd State)?
- Can see play count so I know if this is underplayed
- The tags directly justify the position

---

## 6. Functional Requirements

### Timeline View
- **Display:** Seven time/setting phases (Sunrise Reset, Warm-up, Festival Brunch, Pool Party, Afterglow, Club, Late Night Warehouse)
- **Interaction:** Click phase → loads constellation view
- **Behavior:** Visual feedback on selected phase

### Constellation View (Pool Party Only)
- **Display:** Spatial arrangement of 40–50 Pool Party tracks
- **Zones:** Three visually distinct zones (Arrivals, Lock-in, Wanderers)
- **Zone labels:** Clear text labels or visual grouping
- **Spatial logic:** X-axis = Journey Role (Opener → Home Stretch), Y-axis = Crowd State (Arrivals → Wanderers)
- **Interaction:** Hover shows nearby tracks; click shows details
- **Visual feedback:** Responsive (<100ms latency)

### Track Detail View
- **Display:** Artist, duration, tags (Time/Setting, Journey Role, Crowd State), play count
- **Signal:** Underplayed flag (play count < 5)
- **Interaction:** Click to view, back to constellation

### Spatial Positioning
- **Approach:** Intentional (hardcoded/manual), not algorithmic
- **Justification:** Every track position traceable to its tags
- **Result:** DJ can understand "why is this track positioned here?"

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Hover interaction response: <100ms
- Navigation between views: smooth, <300ms
- No crashes or broken states during demo

### Data
- 150 tracks in demo library
- Track metadata: artist, title, duration, play count, three tags (Time, Role, Crowd)
- Format: JSON or similar (loadable in frontend)

### Responsiveness
- Works on laptop/desktop (primary)
- Readable at presentation distance (10+ feet away)
- Color contrast is accessible

---

## 8. Out of Scope (MVP)

### Explicitly NOT Building
- Audio playback / music player
- AI or algorithmic recommendations
- Real djay SDK integration
- User accounts or persistent storage
- Custom tag creation
- Search or filter UI
- Analytics dashboard
- Multiple fully-built time phases (Pool Party only)

### Why These Are Out of Scope
- Keep technical scope light (24-hour sprint)
- Solve the core problem (library browsing) before adding features
- Don't confuse the user with extra features
- Maintain focus on demo narrative

### Post-Hackathon Roadmap
- Real djay integration
- User accounts + cloud sync
- All five time phases
- Optional algorithmic tag suggestions
- Analytics and insights

---

## 9. MVP Scope Summary

### What You're Building
1. **Timeline view** showing five day phases
2. **Pool Party constellation** with three zones, 40–50 real tracks
3. **Track detail view** showing artist, tags, play count
4. **Demo library:** 150 real Creative Commons/royalty-free tracks, manually tagged
5. **Hover interaction** showing spatial proximity
6. **Clear zone labels** (Arrivals, Lock-in, Wanderers)

### What You're NOT Building
- Other time phases (fully built)
- Audio or playback
- AI or recommendations
- User signup or persistence
- djay integration
- Search or advanced filtering

### Why This Scope
- Proves the concept works for one real DJ scenario

---

## 12. Demo Narrative (High-Level)

### 30-Second Hook
You're at Burning Man. You have scheduled gigs, but you might get asked to play a sunrise wind-down or a 4 AM dance floor. You need to be ready for *anything*. Afterglow lets you organize your library by context so you're always prepared—no scrambling, no "I don't know what I have."

### 60-Second Full Story
**Problem:** DJs prepare by browsing metadata (genre, BPM). But that's not how you actually think when prepping a gig. You think: When would I play this? Why? What crowd?

**Insight:** If we organize your library by *how you actually navigate it* (context, role, crowd state), you're ready faster and you rediscover material you'd forgotten.

**Solution:** Three-layer model: Timeline (choose your context) → Constellation (spatial map of your library by performance dimensions) → Track details (see why each track belongs).

**Benefit:** You're ready for spontaneous moments. You prep in 10 minutes instead of 30. You feel confident across uncertainty.

### 5–7 Minute Walkthrough
1. **Setup:** "I'm at Burning Man. I have a scheduled evening set, but I might get asked to play sunrise or 4 AM." (30 sec)
2. **Open Timeline:** Show five contexts (Sunrise Reset, Daytime, Pool Party, Evening, Late Night) (30 sec)
3. **Select Sunrise Reset:** Constellation loads with your sunrise tracks organized by zones (Arrivals, Lock-in, Wanderers) (60 sec)
4. **Explain the logic:** X-axis = Journey Role (Opener → Home Stretch), Y-axis = Crowd State. Why this matters. (60 sec)
5. **Hover interaction:** Show nearby tracks responding, revealing relationships (30 sec)
6. **Find the hero track:** Click on an underplayed track (play count < 5), see why it belongs (Bridge, Lock-in) (60 sec)
7. **The moment:** "This is perfect. I haven't played it in 6 months but it's exactly what I need for sunrise." (30 sec)
8. **Close:** "That's Afterglow. Be ready for anything." (15 sec)

## 13. Team & Timeline

### Team Composition
- **PM / Visionary:** Curate demo library, own narrative, make product calls
- **Visualizer / Creative Technologist:** Design spatial encoding, build UI, implement interactions

### Timeline (Hackathon)
- **Hours 0–2:** Planning & setup (confirm spatial encoding, start library)
- **Hours 2–8:** Heavy lift (finish library, build timeline + constellation structure)
- **Hours 8–16:** Integration (load real data, add zone labels, implement hover)
- **Hours 16–22:** Testing & refinement (walkthrough, fix bugs, polish)
- **Hours 22–24:** Final polish & backup (one full run-through, screenshots, fallback plan)

### Success Definition
- **By hour 24:** Walkable demo, no crashes, rediscovery moment testable, script practiced

---

## 14. Assumptions & Risks

### Assumptions
- Real CC/royalty-free tracks are available and findable (Creative Commons Music, Bandcamp, Free Music Archive)
- Spatial browsing is genuinely faster than list browsing (hypothesis to prove in demo)
- Manual tagging for 150 tracks is feasible in 6–8 hours
- Judges value understanding real DJ problems over visual polish

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Demo library tagging takes too long | Have pre-curated list ready; alias method (tag 50, extrapolate) |
| Spatial interaction is sluggish | Prioritize responsiveness; test hover latency early |
| Rediscovery track doesn't land | Have 3–5 backup candidates identified during curation |
| Tech breaks during demo | Screenshots, second laptop, printed fallback |
| Judge doesn't understand spatial logic | Clear zone labels, demo script explains logic |

---

## 15. Open Questions (For Alignment)

These are resolved or will be during planning/build:

- [ ] Exact spatial encoding details (will be confirmed with visualizer)
- [ ] Final track count (150 target; 100 minimum)
- [ ] Which Creative Commons sources to use
- [ ] Exact rediscovery track (will be chosen during curation)
- [ ] Tech stack (React? Vue? HTML+JS?)
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints (focus on desktop; mobile nice-to-have)

## 16. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Constellation** | Spatial arrangement of tracks by performance contexts (zones) |
| **Zone** | Cluster within constellation (Arrivals, Lock-in, Wanderers) |
| **Time/Setting** | When/where you'd play a track (Pool Party, Sunrise Reset, etc.). Pick 1–2, each with confidence (1-10). |
| **Journey Role** | What a track does in a set (Opener, Bridge, Reset, Home Stretch). Pick 1–2+, each with confidence (1-10). |
| **Crowd State** | Who's here and what's their attention (Arrivals, Lock-in, Wanderers). Pick 1–2, each with confidence (1-10). |
| **Confidence** | 1-10 rating for each tag indicating certainty. 1=barely fits, 10=definitely. Allows "Pool Party (9) + Afterglow (4)". |
| **Rediscovery** | Finding underplayed material in context |
| **Underplayed** | Track with play count < 5 |
| **MVP** | Minimum viable product for hackathon (Pool Party + demo) |
